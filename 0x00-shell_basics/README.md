In Week 2 of the Foundations of Linux in the ALX Software Engineering program, learners typically dive deeper into essential Linux concepts and commands, focusing on permissions, file ownership, and user management. You learn how to change file permissions using chmod, manage file ownership with chown, and understand user roles and access control. The week also introduces the use of su and sudo for privilege escalation, and working with different user groups. This stage is crucial for building a strong foundation in managing a secure and multi-user Linux environmentâ€”skills that are vital for system administration and software engineering tasks.
