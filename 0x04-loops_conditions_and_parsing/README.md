This week, I deepened my understanding of Shell scripting, especially around conditional statements, loops, and script debugging. I learned how to automate repetitive tasks using if, else, elif, and case statements. I also practiced writing scripts with for loops to simplify tasks like checking file types, manipulating strings, and processing user inputs. Mastering these concepts is helping me think more like a systems engineerâ€”focused on automation, efficiency, and clarity. Overall, Week 6 has pushed me to write cleaner, more purposeful Bash code.
