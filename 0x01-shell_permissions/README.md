In Week 3 of the ALX Foundations of Linux course, the focus was on file permissions, ownership, and user management. This included learning how to switch users using su, change file permissions with chmod, change file ownership using chown, and manage group ownership with chgrpThe week also covered understanding symbolic (rwx) and numeric (e.g., 755) permission notations, how Linux enforces access control, and how to manage users and groups using commands like useradd, usermod, and groupadd. All tasks aimed to help build a strong understanding of how to control access and maintain security in a multi-user Linux environment.
