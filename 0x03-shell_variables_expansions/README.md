In Week 5 of the ALX Foundations of Linux course, the focus is on creating, manipulating, and navigating filesystems, particularly using wildcards, pathname expansion, and file management tools. I learned how to use wildcards like *, ?, and [] for flexible filename matching, and commands like cp, mv, rm, and find to manage files and directories efficiently. This week also emphasized safe file operations, recursive actions, and combining commands for powerful automation. These skills are crucial for handling complex directory structures and automating common file tasks in a Linux environment.
