In Week 4 of the ALX Foundations of Linux course, the focus is on I/O redirections and filters. I learned how to manage input and output streams using redirection operators like >, >>, <, and how to chain commands using pipes (|). This week also introduced powerful text-processing tools like cat, head, tail, cut, sort, uniq, wc, and grep. I practiced manipulating file content, extracting specific data, and filtering text from command outputs, which are essential skills for automating tasks and processing logs in a Linux environment.
