This week, I focused on deepening my understanding of conditional logic, file evaluation, and loop structures in Bash scripting. I learned how to control script flow using if, elif, and else statements, and how to use while, until, and case statements effectively. I also practiced writing scripts that interact with files—checking if they exist, if they're empty, or if they're regular files—using test expressions like -e, -f, and -s. This helped me see how powerful and flexible Bash scripting can be for automating system-level tasks. Week 7 was both challenging and rewarding as it sharpened my logic-building and problem-solving skills in the Linux environment
